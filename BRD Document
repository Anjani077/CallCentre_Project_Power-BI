Call Centre Performance & Customer Experience Analysis

1. Project Overview

Project Name: Call Centre Analytics Dashboard
Prepared By: Business Analyst / Data Analyst
Tool: Power BI

2. Business Background

The Call Centre is a critical customer touchpoint. Poor response times, unresolved calls, and low satisfaction directly impact:

Customer retention

Brand perception

Operational costs

Management requires a centralized analytics dashboard to monitor call handling efficiency, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.

3. Business Problem Statement

The organization lacks visibility into:
