Call Centre Dashboard – Key Insights

1️⃣ Call Volume & Trend Insights

The call volume across January (1455), February (1298), and March (1301) is relatively stable.

There is no extreme spike, indicating predictable workload.

This stability allows better workforce planning instead of reactive staffing.

Insight: Call demand is consistent → inefficiency is not due to volume fluctuation.

2️⃣ Call Answer Rate Insight

Approximately 81% of calls are answered, while ~19% remain unanswered.

Nearly 1 in 5 customers fail to connect with an agent.

Business Impact:
Unanswered calls lead to:

Poor customer experience

Increased repeat calls

Higher operational cost

3️⃣ Resolution Rate Insight

Among answered calls, ~72.9% are resolved, while ~27.1% remain unresolved.

This shows that answering a call does not guarantee issue resolution.

Insight:
The main problem is resolution quality, not just call pickup.

4️⃣ Average Speed of Answer (ASA) Insight

Average Speed of Answer = 67.52 seconds

This wait time is relatively high for a call centre environment.

Correlation Observed:
Higher ASA → Lower customer satisfaction scores.

Insight:
Reducing ASA will directly improve customer satisfaction.

5️⃣ Customer Satisfaction Insight

Average Satisfaction Rating = 3.40 / 5

This indicates moderate satisfaction, not excellence.

Interpretation:
Customers are getting basic support but not a “delightful” experience.

6️⃣ Agent Performance Insights

From the Agent Statistics table:

Agents like Dan and Martha show:

Higher resolved calls

Better satisfaction ratings

Some agents handle a similar number of calls but achieve lower satisfaction.

Insight:
Performance variation exists → training and best-practice sharing needed.

7️⃣ Resolution vs Satisfaction Insight

Even resolved calls do not always translate into high satisfaction.

This suggests:

Communication quality issues

Incomplete explanations

Long handling time despite resolution

Insight:
Customer satisfaction depends on how the issue is handled, not just whether it is resolved.

8️⃣ Funnel Analysis Insight (MOST IMPORTANT)
Call Centre Funnel:
Total Calls
→ Answered Calls
→ Resolved Calls
→ Satisfied Customers

Observed Drop-offs:

Total → Answered: Staffing or routing gap

Answered → Resolved: Agent skill / process gap

Resolved → Satisfied: Experience quality gap

 Insight:
The largest opportunity for improvement lies after the call is answered, not before.

Key Business Insights Summary:

Call volume is manageable and predictable

Nearly 20% call loss occurs before reaching agents

Almost 27% of answered calls are unresolved

 Business Recommendations (Based on Insights):

Improve first-call resolution through agent training

Use top-performing agents as benchmarks

Monitor unanswered calls during peak hours

Focus on quality of interaction, not just resolution
